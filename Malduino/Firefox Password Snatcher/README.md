**Firefox Password Snatcher v2**
- Opens firefox and goes to saved credentials
- Shows all passwords and takes a screenshot (PrintScreen)
- Goes to a website to upload the screenshot (https://ctrlv.cz/)
- Copies Link and sends it to you via email

**Modified**
- I had to do the special characters ($, @) like this (CTRL ALT 4, CTRL ALT 2). I don't know if this applies to just the Finnish keyboard but my malduino couldn't type the special characters as they were. (That's why the script looks little bit junky xD)

**Requirements:**
- Gmail account with unknown apps allowed (https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps)
- Windows 7/8/10 (Might work on other versions of windows but these work 100%)
- Firefox 55.0.3 or newer
